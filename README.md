# SQL Skills Project

This project is based on the Northwind Trades Database. Northwind Trades is a fictional company that imports and exports a variety of goods including but not excluded to: 
beverages, condiments, confections, dairy products, etc. Northwind Trades has a database made up of 13 tables including supplier, product, customer and employee information. This project excavates the database and provides interesting insights about:

- Breakdown of sales regions, showing most and least profitable regions, average sales per city, etc.
- Discontinued products and data showing why they may have been discontinued
- Top 30 selling items for Northwind Trades
- Cost of freight and average speed of shipping companies
- Employees age when hired, seniority and total sales for each employee

In addition to insights about the data, this project uses the following functions and expressions:

- CTEs
- Windows using rank function and partition by clause
- Distinct, Min, Max, JulianDay functions
- Inner and Left Joins, Group By and Having statements

Hopefully you enjoy reading this project as much as I enjoyed doing it. Although, I doubt it!
